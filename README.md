# FacultyDevelopment
Faculty Development Database Berea College

This class was a focus on a team building assignment that allowed us as students to get experience working with people
in the real world. My group of 4 was given a choice of 5 different projects to undertake and we as a group decided to take on the
Berea College's Faculty Development project.

A little about the project: We were tasked with creating a system that allowed the user to modify and track the attendence of several
different events for the faculty members on Berea's Campus. 

We worked with our client to get exactly what they wanted in the program and set off to design the program for the first 
half of the semester. My specific role in the group was to be a facilitator to control our time management as a group, as 
well as setting up meetings with our client on a normal basis. 

Within the group I primarily worked on the front end of the project with HTML, CSS, very little javascript, and PHP.

Contact me if there are any questions about our project. Thanks.
